# V

To install V on Debian like systems (from source):

1. Clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/vlang/v`

2. Switch into the new **v** directory:

`cd v`

3. Build the source:

`make`

This will generate a v executable. 

You can then compile your hello_world.v file with the following:

./v hello_world.v

and execute it with ./hello_world

You may want to move the **v** directory to a location on your path 
(or alternatively add your **v** directory to your path to make 
calling it easier. This is left as an exercise for the reader.
