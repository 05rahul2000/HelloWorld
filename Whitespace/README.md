# Whitespace

## Install
**Note:** Best practice would be to do this using a Python virtual environment,
but that is beyond the scope of this tutorial and is left as an exercise for 
the reader. 
 
**Note:** You will need to have Python3 and Pip3 installed before proceeding. 

`pip3 install whitespace`

## Run Your Code

`whitespace hello_world.ws`
