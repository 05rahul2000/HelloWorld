# Hello World !
This repo is meant to contain hello world programs in various programming languages and their installations (Mainly for linux).

#### Procedure to add programs:

- Since all are collaborators, you just need to upload the file for ease and after you upload, instead of committing directly to `Master`, you just need to create a new branch and then new PR there onwards.

Alternatively,

- Clone to repo to your local machine: `git clone `
(Before committing all files, check if all files are staged atleast. It can be checked using `git status`).
- Make a new branch to make PR: `git checkout -b <branch_name>`
- Add your programs in correct locations: `git add .`. (Adds all files here)
- Commit your changes: `git commit -m "Some_Random_Message"`. (Committed all files)
- Finally, you just need to push all the changes by doing: `git push origin <branch_name>`. 

Now, come to this repo and you will find an option to push and make new PR for the changes you made just now. Make a PR and add some collaborators as your reviewers.
Check your Hacktoberfest Profile to check if PR count increased or not.
