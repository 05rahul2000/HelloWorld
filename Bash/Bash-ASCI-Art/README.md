# Bash with ASCII text

This may seem a bit silly, but this technique has a real use. You can use this 
to display the hostname of a machine when logging in using ssh. 

Bash is already installed on most Linux machines, so you only need to change 
the file permissions to make it executable:

`chmod 744 hello_world.sh`

you can then run the executable script with the following:

`./hello_world.sh`

You can generate your own ASCII text here:

## Quick tip:
Use the up and down arrow keys to navigate through the various fonts, rather 
than using the dropdown selector and your mouse - it is much faster and easier.
