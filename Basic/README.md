# Basic

## Installation 

Yabasic can be installed on Debian like systems with the following command:

`sudo apt install yabasic`

## Run Your Code

`yabasic hello_world.yab`

**Note:** The line number (10) in the hello_world.yab file is not strictly 
neccesary, but I included it out of nostalgia; Basic was the first 
programming language I learned.
