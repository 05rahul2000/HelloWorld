# GlueLang

## Installation Steps

To install GlueLang (from source):

1. Clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/ryuichiueda/GlueLang.git`

2. Switch into the new **GlueLang** directory:

`cd GlueLang`

3. Build the source:

`make`

This will generate a glue executable in ~/.glue/bin/.. 

## Run Your Code

At this point you can run your hello_world.glue file with the following:

`~/.glue/bin/glue hello_world.glue`

or add ~/.glue/bin to your PATH (left as an exercise for the reader - see link below for more details)

and run it with:

`glue hello_world.glue`
